# swift-fsmlib

A cross-platform Swift library for finite state machines (FSMs) and FSM conversion tools.

## Overview

`swift-fsmlib` provides robust, type-safe tools for defining, analysing, and converting finite state machines. Its design is idiomatic Swift, supporting both macOS and Linux, and aims to facilitate both research and production use.

- **FSM**: Core framework for FSMs, including state, transition, and event management.
- **fsmconvert**: Tool for creating FSM arrangements and for converting between FSM representations and formats.

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation is available via DocC in the source tree:

- `Sources/fsmconvert/fsmconvert.docc/`

## Getting Started

See the [Getting Started](Sources/FSM/FSM.docc/GettingStarted.md) guide for a walkthrough on defining and using FSMs.
