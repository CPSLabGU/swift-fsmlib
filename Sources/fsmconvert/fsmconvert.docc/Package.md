The ``fsmconvert`` module provides utilities for converting FSMs between different representations and formats.

## Background

FSM conversion is essential for interoperability with other tools, standards, and storage formats. This module aims to make conversion seamless and robust for Logic-labelled Finite-State Machines (LLFSMs).

## Features

- Convert LLFSMs to and from C, C++, Objective-C, and Objective-C++
- Extensible for new formats
