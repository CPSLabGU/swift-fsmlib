# ``FSM``

The ``FSM`` module provides a high-performance, type-safe framework
for defining and manipulating finite state machines in Swift.
It is designed for both academic and production use, supporting extensibility
and cross-platform compatibility.

## Background

Finite state machines (FSMs) are mathematical models of computation widely used in software engineering, linguistics, and hardware design. This library aims to make FSMs accessible and idiomatic for Swift developers.

## Features

- Type-safe state and transition definitions
- Supports FSMs in various programming languages
- Serialisation and deserialisation utilities
- Extensible conversion tools

For detailed usage, see the tutorials and API documentation.
