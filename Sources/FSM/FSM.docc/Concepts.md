# FSM Concepts

This page covers key concepts underpinning the ``FSM`` framework.

## States and Events

States represent the possible configurations of a system. Events trigger transitions between states.

## Transitions

A transition defines how an FSM moves from one state to another in response to an event.

## Determinism

Arrangements of LLFSMs are executed following a deterministic, non-preemptive, sequential schedule.

## Serialisation

FSMs can be serialised to and from various formats for persistence and interoperability.
