/// Boilerplate for C-based machines.

/// generating C-based finite-state machines, including includes, variables,
/// functions, and state actions. It provides a mapping from section names to
/// code fragments, supporting serialisation and code generation for C and
/// C-derived languages.
///
/// - Note: Use this struct to manage and inject language-specific boilerplate
///         when generating C or C++ FSMs, ensuring consistency and
///         extensibility for new code sections.
