/// Representation of a finite-state machine (FSM) instance.

/// its unique name, type file, and a reference to the underlying machine.
/// Instances are used to represent specific occurrences of FSMs within an
/// arrangement, supporting unique identification and type association.
///
/// - Note: The `name` property must be unique within an arrangement, while
///         the `typeFile` does not have to be unique. This allows multiple
///         instances of the same FSM type to be instantiated with different
///         names.
