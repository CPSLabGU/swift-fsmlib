/// Extension providing serialisation-related filename constants.
///
/// This extension defines filename constants used for serialising and
/// deserialising arrangements of finite-state machines. These filenames are
/// used when reading or writing lists of machines to text files.
///
/// - Note: The `machines` constant specifies the name of the text file that
///         contains machine names, one per line, for arrangement serialisation.
extension Filename {
    /// Name of the text file containing machine names (one per line).
    @usableFromInline static let machines = "Machines"
